# purple_starter

## Overview

This is a very early demo of the starter. Currently, it lacks documentation, setup tooling, and tests. Otherwise – it is complete and usable. 

Check for updates frequently – it won't take long to complete the remaining parts.

## TODO

- [ ] Documentation
- [ ] Setup tool
- [ ] Tests
- [x] Extraction of analysis_options to a separate package
